# Fashion Recognition using Fashion-MNIST

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories.

The model is trained using **TensorFlow/Keras** and achieves high classification accuracy with minimal preprocessing.
